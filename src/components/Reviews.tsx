            "We've felt Ayesha as a warm and sincere person right from the first day we met. We had enrolled our son at 2.5 years here and been continuing for close to 2 years now. As parents, we were nervous initially as our son wasn't used to eating variety of foods and being away from us for long hours. But, Ayesha has been always accommodating of our needs and giving us regular updates on kid's daily activities and food intake. Our son too is enthusiastic about going to Ayesha's Daycare everyday. He sure has fun with his friends while also, doing activities throughout the day. We're extremely grateful we found a place as Ayesha's for our kid. We have always recommended Ayesha's Sunkiss academy to our friends and would like to do the same here.",

            "Ayesha is a great teacher and very warm and caring towards kids. My daughter started going to Ayesha's daycare when she was 2 years old and she has been there for 2 years now. My daughter loves going to her daycare and she has learned so much from Ayesha. Ayesha is very patient and caring towards the kids. She is very good at communicating with the parents and keeping them updated on the kids activities. I would highly recommend Ayesha's daycare to anyone who is looking for a safe and caring environment for their kids.",

            "We had enrolled our kid at Ayesha's daycare when he was 14 months. He was there for 1.5 year. The only reason, we had to move him out was because we moved to a different city. Ayesha is a very caring and loving person. She takes care of kids like her own. She is very professional and always keeps us updated about the kids activities. She is very patient and takes care of kids very well. My son loved going to her daycare. I would highly recommend Ayesha's daycare to anyone who is looking for a safe and caring environment for their kids.",

            "Ayesha is so kind and caring. My son started with her at 6 months old and I was so nervous, but she was incredibly patient with me and my son. She was always available to answer questions and provide updates. My son loved going to her daycare and I always felt comfortable leaving him in her care. I would highly recommend Ayesha to anyone looking for a safe and caring environment for their child.",
